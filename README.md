# League of Legends Stats - NAME TBD

Hi! Welcome to my League of Legends stats site.

The goal of this project is recreate functionality of existing League of Legends stat sites, but with a more appealing UI.
Throughout development my main focus is to improve my React knowledge and learn the new features of Next.js 13.4, while also diving deep into the features of CSS.


## Motivation

Currently my experiences as a Junior Full Stack Software Engineer has given me more experience with backend development than frontend development. As a result, I have areas of weakness in my frontend development skills. 

I have decided to create this project to improve my frontend development skills, specifically in React and CSS.
